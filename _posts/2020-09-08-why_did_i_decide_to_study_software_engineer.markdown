As a music production major I never thought I'd be learning Software Engineering. But as I sat in my lectures at my college I thought why am I doing this. Spending money to be stuck in an hour long class to get a degree that won't guarantee me my desired future or career. I was wasting my time when i can be working towards something that can lead me to want I want for myself.

After dropping out of college I was on a search to find what I can do instead that will lead me to my goals and dreams in life. It was a search that lead me to different google searches,  jobs, and mindsets. My search was indeed a mental struggle for my path and I endured hardships during that time. Even though the path was not clear or straght forward, it did lead me to my biggest challenge I have yet to encounter. Learning to code.

While looking for ways to learn to code whether it be self-taught or bootcamps. I came across an alumi from Flatiron School who inspired me to take this leap and apply. Her story of being enrolled in the program, struggling through it and achieving her goals after graduating was all I needed to start this journey that is nerve-racking and exciting.
